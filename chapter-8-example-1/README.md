# chapter-8-example-1

Code for example 1 from Chapter 8 of [Bootstrapping Microservices](https://www.bootstrapping-microservices.com).

In chapter 8 we create a continuous delivery pipeline for microservices and infrastructure using GitHub Actions.

This example is the simplest possible example of using GitHub Actions. This is the "Hello world" of GitHub Actions workflows.

The worflow automatically runs the shell script that's in this code repository whenever you push code changes to GitHub.
